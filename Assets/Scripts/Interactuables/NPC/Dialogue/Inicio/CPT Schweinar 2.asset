  npcText: "Behind him stands his complete opposite. While this chubby man could
    hardly frighten anyone, guarding him is a Rauch Korp, one of the Kaiser\u2019s
    elite. When they patrol the streets, people step aside. And if they knock on
    your door, it means your life is about to get worse. Everyone fears them, and
    for good reason. Armed with a machine gun capable of firing dozens of bullets
    per second and protected by a black bulletproof cuirass, though perhaps the most
    intimidating thing about them are their helmets, particularly the prominent blood-red
    visor."
