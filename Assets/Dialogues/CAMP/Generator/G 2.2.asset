  npcText: FAILURE (-1 Health) In your eagerness, you try to rip the chassis off.
    Everything seemed fine until you heard the "crack." Unfortunately, it wasn't
    the chassis giving way, but some bone or joint in your back, leaving you with
    blurry vision from the pain. To make matters worse, you don't seem to have made
    any progress with the chassis. You hit your tools against the metal in frustration,
    to no effect. Defeated, you realize a different approach is needed. Or perhaps
    the sensible thing is to admit defeat.
