  npcText: FAILURE With the grace of a donkey, you end up breaking one of the rusted
    screws while it was still lodged in the chassis. You try to wiggle it free with
    your tools, but in the jostling, you only make the situation worse. By the time
    you give up, the chassis is somehow more rigid than before. Defeated, you realize
    a different approach is needed. Or perhaps the sensible thing is to admit defeat.
