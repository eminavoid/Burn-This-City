  npcText: 'SUCCESS (+1 Logic) You start by analyzing your surroundings. The camp
    is in the middle of a barren lot, but it''s been filled with all sorts of crates
    and machinery to keep it going. One of these machines is right next to him. It''s
    a generator, quite old by the looks of it, and it has one particularity that
    makes it stand out from the others in the camp: it''s turned off. Next, you analyze
    the man himself. His clothes are stained with motor oil, and he seems to be leaning
    against the engine, as if trying to hide it from view.
