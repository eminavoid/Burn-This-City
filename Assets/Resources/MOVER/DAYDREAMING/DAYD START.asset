  npcText: "In front of you lies a vast expanse of ruins, factories, and, of course,
    the pride of Diesmark: the Hoherstahl, the great obelisk that, even after the
    siege, still stands tall and proud at the center of the city. The landscape feels
    almost fantastical; how many times did you gaze upon the city\u2019s skyline,
    losing yourself in its countless nooks and turns? One could spend a lifetime
    exploring it with their eyes and still leave secrets undiscovered. And now? Now
    all those secrets, all those stories\u2026 lie buried beneath the ruins of what
    used to be your home. You catch yourself daydreaming\u2026"
  choices:
  - playerText: (K - EASY) What became of the Hoherstahl now that the city has fallen?
