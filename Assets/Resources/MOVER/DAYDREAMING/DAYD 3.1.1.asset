  npcText: Part of you, however, wished you had stayed buried. When you emerged,
    you could not believe what you were seeing. Your house, your street, your entire
    district was being bombed. You spent hours trying to dig your family out, even
    as more explosions tore the ground open only a few meters away. Eventually you
    found them, or what was left of them. Everything after that is a blur. You wandered
    through the chaos until you somehow ended up at the refugee camp. And now you
    are here. You wonder if this nightmare will ever end.
