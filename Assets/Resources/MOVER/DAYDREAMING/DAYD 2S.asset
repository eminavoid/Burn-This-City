  npcText: "SUCCESS The industrial district\u2026 once the heart of Diesmark, its
    factories fed the insatiable hunger of the Rauchreich for generations, and during
    the rebellion it was the greatest advantage the VLC had during the war. When
    Diesmark fell, the VLC collapsed. Now its purpose is far more sinister. As punishment
    for rising up, the Rauchreich decreed that the industrial district would produce
    day and night until the blood debt is paid. To satisfy the massive demand for
    labor, the Rauchkorps have taken to kidnapping   the homeless, forcing them to
    work until they die in that industrial hell. A fate that, if you fail to escape,
    could become your own."
