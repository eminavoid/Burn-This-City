  npcText: "SUCCESS After a long and nerve-racking inspection, you manage to confirm
    that the bomb is still armed. Why it did not go off is another question entirely,
    but the faint vibration coming from inside it, along with the charged tension
    in the air around it, betrays the lie of its supposed safety. On one hand, standing
    this close to a live bomb is not exactly the healthiest plan. On the other\u2026
    leaving it here could mean the death of countless innocents. And it is not as
    if the Rauchreich would lift a finger if you reported it. More likely, they would
    arm it on purpose just to avoid dealing with it later."
