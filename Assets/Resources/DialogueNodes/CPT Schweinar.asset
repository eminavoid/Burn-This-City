  npcText: "In front of you stands an officer of the Rauchmacht. Fat and pompous,
    with rosy cheeks and a uniform stained with grease. He looks like a bad joke,
    while Diesmark starves, the man in charge of deciding who gets a transit visa
    to escape this damned city looks like a pig ready for dinner. He hasn\u2019t
    yet acknowledged your presence, choosing instead to examine a pile of messy papers
    on his desk while chewing on the end of his pencil. From the insignia on his
    chest, you recognise him as a captain, though it\u2019s doubtful he ever fought
    on the frontlines. A man like this would\u2019ve been cannon fodder during the
    rebellion."
