  npcText: 'Get a transit visa. There''s no chance of survival out there, and to
    be honest, there wasn''t much of a future for you in the camp to begin with.
    The visa is your ticket out of this damned city, but they''re impossible to get
    for nobodies like you. Still, somewhere out there, there has to be a way to get
    one.

    You have no other choice, you need that visa. And nothing can stand
    in your way of getting it. Even if you have to burn this city to the ground.
