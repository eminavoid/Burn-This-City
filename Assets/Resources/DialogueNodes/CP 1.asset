  npcName: Corpse Pile
  npcText: "At the far end of the room, you find the source of the carnage: a group
    of five, maybe six insurgents, piled on top of each other. They've been completely
    riddled with bullets. The Korps' machine guns are so powerful that against unarmored
    human bodies, they turn flesh to mincemeat. You knew this already, but seeing
    it in person is\u2026 deeply unsettling. One of these mangled corpses in the
    pile must be the man you were supposed to deliver the letter to."
  choices:
  - playerText: (P - MEDIUM) Try to see if any of them have the key, disturbing as
      few of the bodies as possible.
