  npcText: "The commissioner quickly analyzes your documents. He has been doing this
    for dozens of people a day for months, and without any help, so he has become
    very adept at processing information effectively and efficiently. In a matter
    of minutes, he seems to have reached a verdict. You were expecting the usual
    stamp, a quick farewell, and the call for the next refugee. But this time, this
    time is different.\r\nHe looks at you with a hint of pity. You fear what his
    next words will be, even though you already know them.\n\r\n\"Bad news, citizen.
    Your number came up in the lottery. We have to economize the little space and
    supplies we have. And, regrettably, you weren't productive enough to be exempt
    from the draw. You're going to have to leave the camp.\"\r"
