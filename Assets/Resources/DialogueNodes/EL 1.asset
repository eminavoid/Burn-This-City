  npcText: "Before you stands the elevator that connects all floors of the Obelisk.
    You push the bottom to call it and take a deep breath, this is almost over. Yet,
    as you wait for it to arrive, you can't help but wonder if helping the insurgents
    is really the best move. Maybe the Rauchreich could help you just as much as
    Karolin Reiter and her rebels, if not more. Instead of heading to the foundations
    as instructed, you could visit one of the high-ranking officers in the occupation
    forces. You're sure they'd be very interested in what you have to say\u2026\r\nAs
    the elevator arrives, one thing becomes clear: whatever you choose, the time
    to decide is now.\r\n"
