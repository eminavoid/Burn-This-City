  npcText: You prepare to continue your path through the dark sewer, but what you
    see ahead stops you cold. A beacon glows red, pulsing like the eye of a cyclops
    guarding its domain. It is a landmine, probably placed by the insurgents to keep
    people from finding the entrance to their hideout. You really wish the guard
    at the entrance had warned you about dangers like this.
  choices:
  - playerText: Use your tools to safely disarm it (TOOLS)
