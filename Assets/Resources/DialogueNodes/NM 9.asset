  npcText: 'The man gives a quiet, celebratory gesture but quickly composes himself.
    His spirit may be broken, but it seems he still believes in his cause.

    boy! That''s what I like to hear! Now get going. If you leave now, you might
    make it before dark. Nights in this part of the city aren''t pretty at all. Specially
