  npcName: THE HOLE
  npcText: SUCCESS After carefully examining the shape of the hole and the direction
    the impact must have come from, you figure out that it was caused by some kind
    of projectile. Which is odd, because the structure does not look like it was
    blown apart by an explosion. And this part of the city was never targeted during
    the siege. A stray shell? A misfire? Or something darker at play? You will probably
    never know.
