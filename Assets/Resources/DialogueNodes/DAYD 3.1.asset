  npcText: "You open your eyes\u2026 and the memories hit you like a slap to the
    face. It was morning. You were having breakfast with your family when suddenly
    there was an explosion in the distance, then another, and another. You had grown
    used to those sounds by then, but this time it was different, closer. Before
    you could even react, everything went dark. The blast left you dazed, and the
    debris buried you alive. You could barely breathe or move, but whether it was
    divine intervention or pure chance, a second explosion blew away just enough
    rubble for you to crawl out."
