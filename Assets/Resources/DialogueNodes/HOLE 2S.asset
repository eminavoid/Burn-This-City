  npcText: 'SUCCESS You look down to the bottom of the hole, taking extra care not
    to slip. The fall looks to be about two stories, but you think you could soften
    the landing with a bit of finesse if you decide to jump. At the bottom you can
    make out what seems to be a large metal object, though it is hard to tell exactly
    what it is from up here.
