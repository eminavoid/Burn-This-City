  npcText: 'The man steps closer, invading your personal space until he''s so close
    you can smell his breath.

    "And why do you care? Like you said, it''s a
    free camp. I don''t have to answer your questions. But I''m warning you, mind
    your own business."

    He then takes a step back, not taking his eyes off
    you. He seems to be waiting for you to leave. After a moment, he loses interest
    and goes back to whatever he was doing before you interrupted him.
