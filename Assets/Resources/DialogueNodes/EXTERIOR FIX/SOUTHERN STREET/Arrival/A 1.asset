  npcText: 'You cross to the next block, nothing out of the ordinary. But the moment
    you see what lies ahead, your hatred for the Rauchreich burns anew. Rows upon
    rows of bombed, out houses, piles of rubble twice the height of a person. The
    invaders truly brought hell to earth.

    Still, there might be something useful
    left in the wreckage of what was once your city.
