  npcText: "SUCCESS The man eyes you suspiciously, but you've made him uncertain
    enough that he radios someone while keeping his weapon pointed on you.\r\n\"You
    hear that? Are we expecting a delivery from outside?\"\r\nYou don't hear the
    response, but after what feels like an eternity, the guard lowers his weapon.\r\n\"Alright,
    you can pass. But no funny business. The base is to the right, don't wander off.\"\r"
