  npcText: FAILURE Everything that happened after the siege is a blur to you. Once
    the siege ended, you quickly relocated to the refugee camp. Once there, you managed
    to keep a low profile, staying away from the news. At the time it seemed like
    a good idea. What sense was there in overwhelming yourself with the humiliation
    of your city? But now, looking back, you feel like a fish out of water.
