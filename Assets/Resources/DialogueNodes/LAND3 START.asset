  npcText: You spot yet another mine in your way. This one has no debris on it, but
    it is positioned in such a way that jumping over it is not an option. However,
    you notice some maintenance railings on the ceiling above it. It would take considerable
    upper-body strength, but you might be able to bypass the mine by hanging from
    them and moving across.
  choices:
  - playerText: Use your tools to safely disarm it (TOOLS)
