    One by one, you find items of value that might help you on your journey\u2014but
    no sign of the key. You're about to give up, until you reach into one of the
    dead men's pockets\u2026 and find it! It's cold, like the bodies. But this is
    it\u2026 It has to be. You couldn't stand having to come back into this room
    and search through the corpses again."
