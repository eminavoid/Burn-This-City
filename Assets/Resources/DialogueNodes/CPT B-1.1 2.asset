  npcText: "His laugh is thunderous, like an explosion. So loud that it makes his
    belly and jowls jiggle. Being inside a small metal room doesn\u2019t help muffle
    the annoying noise, until suddenly, it turns into a rough, uncontrollable cough.
    The captain\u2019s face turns red as a tomato, as if he were choking. You glance
    at the Korp behind him, but his red eyes don\u2019t even flinch. Just when you
    think you\u2019ll have to explain why an officer of the Rauchmacht died choking
    right in front of you, the captain gasps for air, and colour returns to his face."
