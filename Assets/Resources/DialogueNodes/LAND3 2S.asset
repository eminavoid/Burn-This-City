  npcText: SUCCESS With considerable strength and plenty of perseverance, you pull
    yourself along the railings and make it to the other side. Your arms burn and
    your grip almost gives out more than once, but you push through. It is exhausting,
    uncomfortable, and far from elegant, yet still infinitely better than getting
    blown to pieces when you are this close to your goal.
