  npcText: "FAILURE The industrial district\u2026 once the heart of Diesmark, its
    factories fed the insatiable hunger of the Rauchreich for generations, and during
    the rebellion it was the main advantage the VLC had in the fight. When Diesmark
    fell, the VLC collapsed. How can a war be won without rifles or ammunition? The
    factories are still running, but for what purpose? You heard rumors, though you
    never paid them much mind. One thing is certain, their production now belongs
    to the Rauchreich."
