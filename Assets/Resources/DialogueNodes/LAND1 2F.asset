  npcText: FAILURE You try to leap over the mine, attempting to clear the deadly
    obstacle with a desperate leap, but you misjudge the distance, the necessary
    arc, or perhaps the mine's detection field is simply wider than anticipated.
    The jump is simply not long enough. A high-pitched whistle cuts through the silence,
    followed by a bright flash of red light. You land just a few centimeters from
    it, close enough to set it off. Panic seizes you in a final, frozen moment as
    you realize the dreadful finality of your misstep.
