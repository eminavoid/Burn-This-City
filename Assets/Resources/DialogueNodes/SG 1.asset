  npcText: As you climb down the service ladder, you realize something's wrong. The
    sewers are dark and quiet. That's normal, they're sewers after all, and you don't
    expect them to be well-kept when an army that only cares about draining the city's
    factories dry is currently running the city. But there's something else in the
    air, a bad feeling you can't explain.
