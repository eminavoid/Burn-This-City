  npcName: Commissioner Elsner
  npcText: SUCCESS The commissioner looks up. For the first time since this conversation
    began, you seem to catch his attention completely. You notice that he clearly
    did not expect that response. He glances around, checking if any guards are nearby,
    but fortunately, none seem to have noticed your threats. He hesitates, searching
    for the right words to avoid escalating the situation further.
