  npcText: 'SUCCESS The commissioner looks at you, startled, as if he can''t believe
    what he''s hearing. He checks your papers again and says to you.

    "You''re
    telling me you did more work than your quota shows? How is that possible? Why
    didn''t you speak up before? By the Dynamo, is there no one in this camp who
    can do their job properly except me?"

    He grumbles under his breath.

    "I''m
    sorry, citizen, but there''s nothing I can do. I''ve already sent the approved
    refugee list up the chain. You''ll have to appeal directly to the provisional
    government to get your spot back."
