  npcText: SUCCESS After a long and nerve-racking inspection, you manage to confirm
    that the bomb is still armed. It seems it failed to detonate because of a malfunction
    in a device located inside it. It is a wonder of Rauchreich engineering, a massive
    explosive charge packed into a payload no larger than a human hand. This allows
    it to be installed in almost any explosive. The mechanical outer shell of this
    model exists only to protect the core and to generate shrapnel when it blows.
    A truly cruel piece of machinery.
