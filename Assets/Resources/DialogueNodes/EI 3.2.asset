  npcText: "FAILURE The Commissioner's pensive face softens a little. However, you
    notice a hint of indifference in his expression; it seems your words did not
    manage to resonate with him. He becomes lost in his thoughts again, only this
    time, it seems you are occupying them completely. He seems to reach a conclusion,
    though by the look on his face, it's clearly not the one you hoped for.\r\n\"I
    am sorry, citizen, but there is nothing more for you here. I have already sent
    the approved refugee list to the provisional government, and you are not on it.
    If the Korps were to find you here... you would endanger the entire camp. You
    have to leave. Now.\"\r"
