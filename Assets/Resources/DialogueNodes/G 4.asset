  npcText: It seems the worst is over; the belt doesn't seem too difficult to fix.
    So, using your tools and the spare parts that were conveniently in the same box,
    you manage to fix it. It's as simple as unhooking the old one and putting the
    new one on. Even a child could do it... which doesn't speak very well of the
    "mechanic." When you finish, you feel satisfied with yourself, knowing that you
    not only overcame the challenge but also did the camp a favor.
