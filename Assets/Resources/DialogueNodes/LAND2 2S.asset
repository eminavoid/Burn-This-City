  npcText: SUCCESS You successfully identify and navigate a relatively stable path
    across the sewer debris. Despite the overpowering stench and noxious conditions,
    your focus on maintaining a steady pace. The crossing is nerve-racking. You pass
    throug uneven uneven terrain that puts you at risk of falling. But ultimately,
    your vigilance paid off. You cleared the treacherous obstruction efficiently,
    emerging unscathed and unstuck on the other side. The immediate, profound relief
    marked a small victory, and the way forward is now open.
