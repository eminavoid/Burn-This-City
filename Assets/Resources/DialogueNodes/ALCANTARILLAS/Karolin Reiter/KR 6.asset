  npcText: 'Ms. Karolin signals to one of the camp members, an older man with a scholarly
    look. When he approaches, she hands him the letter and he disappears with it
    into one of the tents. She then sits on top of a rusted barrel and starts cleaning
    her weapon. She tells you:

    "Wait there a few minutes. Mr. Denker never
    takes long."

    Sure enough, after just a short while, this Mr. Denker emerges
    from the tent with an expression of pure astonishment on his face.
