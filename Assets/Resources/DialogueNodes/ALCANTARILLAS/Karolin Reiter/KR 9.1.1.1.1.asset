    Karolin
    hands you a heavy suitcase that one of her people brought over as she was explaining
    the plan.

    "Once inside, go straight to the reception desk. Don''t stop
    to talk to anyone. Don''t admire the scenery. Walk directly to reception. A pleasant
    woman will be there to assist you. She''ll ask you a few questions. Now LISTEN
    CAREFULLY."
