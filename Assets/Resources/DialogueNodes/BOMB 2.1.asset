  npcText: Even so, its inactive state could change in the blink of an eye. In fact,
    you suspect it is only a matter of time before it detonates. Which puts you in
    a real dilemma. On one hand, standing this close to a live bomb is not exactly
    the healthiest plan. On the other hand, leaving it here could mean the death
    of countless innocents. And it is not as if the Rauchreich would lift a finger
    if you reported it. More likely, they would arm it on purpose just to avoid dealing
    with it later.
