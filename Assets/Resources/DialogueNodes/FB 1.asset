  npcText: "At the end of the street, you come across one of the many displays of
    the Rauchreich's power in the city: a control point. It functions as a barricade
    manned by soldiers, restricting passage to anyone without a transit permit. \r\nIt's
    one of the regime's methods for controlling the population... and ensuring everyone
    stays within the select few streets they permit. Either way, you're not getting
    through here.\r\n"
