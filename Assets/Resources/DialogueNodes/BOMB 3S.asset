  npcText: SUCCESS Using your earlier analysis, you manage to pinpoint the issue
    to being inside the payload. A set of loosely connected wires, probably shaken
    out of place by a rougher launch than usual, caused the detonator to lose contact.
    Which means that a single wrong move could fix that mistake and make it go off
    instantly.
  choices:
  - playerText: (D - EASY) You found the problem, now you just need to carefully
      disconnect the wires responsible for the detonation.
