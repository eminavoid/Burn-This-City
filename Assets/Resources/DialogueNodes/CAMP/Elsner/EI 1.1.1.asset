  npcText: "However, the commissioner is not a bad man. He tends to make fair decisions,
    or the fairest possible given the circumstances, and he does not abuse his power.
    You haven't interacted with him much, mostly just to renew your stay in the camp,
    like most of the refugees.\r\nYou wait for him to finish the announcements before
    you approach him. You just need a stamp on your documents to stay one more week.
    And you've found that right after the morning announcements is the best time
    to get it from him. When he finishes, the crowd disperses and you seize the chance
    to intercept him.\r"
