  npcName: Commissioner Elsner
  npcText: 'FAILURE The commissioner looks up. For the first time since this conversation
    began, you seem to catch his attention completely. You notice that he clearly
    did not expect that response. He frowns, signals for the camp guards to approach
    him, and snarls at you.

    "You really think you can intimidate me in my own
    camp? In front of my guards? I suggest you get out of my sight before my men
    throw you out. That way you can keep what little dignity you have left."

    The
    commissioner pushes you aside and, looking at the line behind you, shouts.

    "NEXT!"
