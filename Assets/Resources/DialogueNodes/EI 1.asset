  npcName: Commissioner Elsner
  npcText: "The commissioner is standing on some old supply crates. A small crowd
    has gathered at his feet, waiting to hear the latest announcements and news from
    the camp, news that will later spread by word of mouth, getting distorted along
    the way. \r\nThe commissioner was appointed by the provisional government, which
    assumed power in the city after the fall of the Last Baron of Diesmark, when
    the city was finally occupied by the Rauchreich. His main job is the organization
    and maintenance of this refugee camp, one of many, first erected when the Rauchreich
    decimated de residential district of the city. It's no surprise that the commissioner
    is a man with few friends. Not only is he a representative of the unpopular provisional
    government, but also, when you're the one who decides who stays and who leaves,
    who eats and who goes hungry, people tend to resent you.\r\n"
