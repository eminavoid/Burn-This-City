    we have running beneath the city. Follow the path marked with yellow paint until
    you reach a set of stairs. These lead to a trapdoor, similar to the one you used
    to enter the sewers. That will bring you out into an alley.\r\nWhen you emerge,
    you'll find yourself on Hauptstra\xDFe, yes, the city's main street, where the
    Obelisk stands. It serves as the Rauchreich's headquarters here in Diesmark,
    along with the offices of the traitors in the provisional government.\"\r\n"
