  npcText: SUCCESS Although your time in the refugee camp kept you from staying informed
    about most events after the siege, you managed to learn the basics. After the
    siege of Diesmark, the Baron was taken to the capital to be executed, and his
    residence, the Hoherstahl, was turned into the headquarters of the Rauchkorps
    and the high command in charge of pacifying the city. So now the pride of Diesmark
    serves as a symbol of oppression over its own people.
