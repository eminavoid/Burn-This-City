  npcText: "SUCCESS With the agility of an acrobat you manage to get past the proximity
    mine without triggering it. The metallic shell of the mine, a dull grey disc
    resting innocently on the sewer\u2019s floor, registers the disturbance of your
    passage, but its not enough to activate. A bead of cold sweat traces a path down
    your temple. Even though you managed it, you don't like how close it came to
    going wrong. A shuddering breath escapes your lips as you put distance between
    yourself and the lethal device."
