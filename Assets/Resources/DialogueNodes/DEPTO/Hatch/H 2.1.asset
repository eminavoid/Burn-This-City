  npcText: "SUCCESS At first, even you weren't sure you could do it. After all, we're
    talking about literally tearing reinforced steel hinges from the floor with your
    bare hands. A normal person couldn't even attpent it, but you... you're not exactly
    normal, are you? Putting your entire body into it, you pull, twist, and strain
    until, with a loud CLANK, the trapdoor gives way, swinging wide open.\r\nIt reveals
    a staircase leading down to the basement. A faint smell of dampness is the only
    reward you get for completing this incredible deed.\r"
