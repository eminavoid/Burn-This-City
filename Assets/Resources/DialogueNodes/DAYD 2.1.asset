  npcText: "The Voltopan Liberation Coalition, or VLC, was a union of Voltopan city-states
    that came together under the leadership of Diesmark to rise up against the iron
    grip of the Rauchreich, the empire that rules the region. It was an entire movement,
    not only military but also social and political. Alas, all of that is now in
    the past. The VLC is nothing more than a memory, although during your stay in
    the refugee camp you heard rumors that the insurgents remain active, hiding beneath
    the city. Unfounded rumors surely\u2026 "
