  npcText: '"You must ask the receptionist for access to all floors of the building.
    Once she grants it, proceed to the lowest sublevel: the foundations. Once there,
    simply place the briefcase against a pillar marked with a yellow ''X'' and press
    this hidden button."

    Karolin shows you a button concealed in the briefcase''s
    handle.


    "Under no circumstances are you to open the briefcase or press
    the button before reaching the third column. There shouldn''t be any guards in
    there. Once you''ve placed it, I strongly recommend you exit the building quickly
    and put as much distance as possible between yourself and it. Any questions?"
