  npcText: "When you speak to the man, he flinches, takes a few steps back, and stares
    at you intently, as if trying to process your words. He's pale and has the look
    of a deeply troubled man. After a moment, he clears his throat and says:\r\n\"Huh?
    Who sent you? Are you... are you with them?\"\r\nHe frantically pats down his
    pockets, and when he doesn't find what he's looking for, he sighs in defeat.\r\n\"Wait
    a second... you said you're here to deliver a letter, right? Did Alaric send
    you? No, he wouldn't have given you his name... A man dressed like me, but more
    discreet.\"\r"
