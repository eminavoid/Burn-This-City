  npcText: On the other side of that trapdoor is a basement. There lies a a service
    entrance to the sewers, not very glamorous, I know, but once you're inside, if
    you head right, you'll eventually find a... little hideout. There, you'll find
    a woman named Karolin Reiter. Tell her Alaric sent you and give her the letter.
    I guarantee you, no matter whatever they originally offered for your services,
    it will be multiplied exponentially."
