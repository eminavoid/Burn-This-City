  npcText: 'You come across one of the many displays of the Rauchreich''s power in
    the city: a control point. It functions as a barricade manned by soldiers, restricting
    passage to anyone without a transit permit. This one is particularly frustrating,
    because it divides a street busy street in two.

    It''s one of the regime''s
    methods for controlling the population... and ensuring everyone stays within
    the select few streets they permit. Either way, you''re not getting through here.
