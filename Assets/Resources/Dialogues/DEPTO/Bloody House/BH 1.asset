  npcText: "The moment you step inside this apartment, the nauseating stench of rotting
    meat, dried blood, and viscera hits you like a freight train. Then, like a boxer
    delivering a one-two punch, you take in the state of the room: the furniture,
    the floor\u2026 even the ceiling. Everything is drenched in blood. You wonder
    if it's a good idea to keep going."
