  npcText: As you approach the engine, the mechanic steps aside to let you work.
    Seeing a turned-off engine in Diesmark is unheard of; despite constant use, constant
    repair keeps them running almost indefinitely. So even though you're helping
    the poor devil pretending to be a mechanic today, the next time he needs help
    and can't find any, they'll probably end up kicking him out. A mechanic in Diesmark
    is as essential as a doctor in a hospital.
