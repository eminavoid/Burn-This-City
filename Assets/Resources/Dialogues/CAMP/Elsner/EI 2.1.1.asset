  npcText: 'With those words, your world comes crashing down. "You''re going to have
    to leave the camp." That means you''ll have to live on the streets of the occupied
    districts. You''ve heard the stories, of how the Korps kidnap the homeless at
    night to take them to the industrial district, where they are forced to work
    in the giant Diesmarker Factories, now controlled by the Rauchreich, in shifts
    of sixteen hours or more a day, every day, for the rest of their short lives.
    A fate worse than death.

    

    It can''t end like this. You have to defend
    yourself. Maybe there''s something you can do to convince the Commissioner that
    he''s wrong, that you deserve a place in the camp!
