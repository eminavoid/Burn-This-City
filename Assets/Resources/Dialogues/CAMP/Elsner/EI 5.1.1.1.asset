  npcName: Commissioner Elsner
  npcText: 'He stares at you for a moment, as if running numbers in his head and
    weighing possibilities, muttering quietly to himself. Then he exclaims loudly,
    though you can''t tell if he''s talking to you or just thinking out loud.

    "If
    you are heard, and the provisional government launches an investigation into
    this camp..."

    Suddenly, the commissioner gives you a slightly exaggerated
    smile, probably the first time you''ve ever seen him do so.

    "When you report
    this to the provisional government, make sure you report the officials who were
    in charge of tracking your quotas, not me. Here, let me give you some supplies
    to help jog your memory about who the real responsible parties are. It certainly
    wasn''t old man Elsner."
