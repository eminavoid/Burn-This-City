  npcName: Commissioner Elsner
  npcText: 'FAILURE The commissioner looks at you sternly; he clearly isn''t buying
    your story.

    "You think you''re the first to try and weasel out like this?
    Please. Even if I believed you, I''ve already submitted the approved refugee
    list. There''s nothing I can do. And for the record, I don''t believe you. My
    subordinates rarely make mistakes with the quotas. Now move along. There''s nothing
    more for you here, and there are honest people waiting behind you."

    The
    commissioner steps to the side and calls out.

    "NEXT!"
