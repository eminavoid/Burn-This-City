  npcText: "SUCCESS The Commissioner's pensive face softens a little. You notice
    a hint of guilt in his expression; it seems your words managed to resonate with
    him. He becomes lost in his thoughts again, only this time, it seems you are
    occupying them completely. He seems to reach a conclusion, though by the look
    on his face, it's clearly not the one you hoped for. Yet you detect a certain
    clemency in his expression.\r\n\"I am sorry, citizen, but there is nothing I
    can do. I have already sent the approved refugee list to the provisional government,
    and you are not on it. If the Korps were to find you here... it would compromise
    the entire camp.\"\r"
