  npcText: "FAILURE You watch the man carefully, analyzing where he's looking, what
    seems to hold his attention, and his body language. But no matter how hard you
    try, you can't figure out what he's doing standing there. However, it seems your
    spying was a bit too obvious, because the mysterious man approaches you.\r\n\"Are
    you deaf? I told you to stop staring. Move along, or we're gonna have a real
    problem.\"\r\nThe man pushes his jacket aside, revealing a revolver.\r"
