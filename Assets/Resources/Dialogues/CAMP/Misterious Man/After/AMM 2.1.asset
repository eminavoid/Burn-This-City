  npcText: 'You pretend not to hear him and continue on your way. However, the man
    doesn''t seem willing to be ignored. In two long strides, he steps in front of
    you, blocking your path before you can continue forward. He clears his throat
    and says:

    "Are you deaf? I''m calling you. And something tells me, from
    what I overheard about your conversation with the commissioner, you''re not in
    a position to turn down... lucrative opportunities."
