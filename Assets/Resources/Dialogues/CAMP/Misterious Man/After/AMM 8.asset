  npcText: 'The man gives you a somewhat strained smile, lets out a deep sigh, and

    "Excellent, excellent. I knew we''d understand each other. Now
    about this letter - it''s private, alright? So don''t even think about reading
    it. Besides, there''s nothing interesting in there anyway."

    He lets the
    words hang in the air for a moment before continuing.

    "If that''s all, comrade,
    I''ll be on my way."

    Before you can get another word in, he slips back into
    the camp and vanishes from sight.
