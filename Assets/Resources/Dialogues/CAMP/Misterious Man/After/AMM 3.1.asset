  npcText: 'You decide to listen to the mysterious man. After all, what could he
    possibly say that''s worse than what the commissioner just told you?

    As
    you approach, he glances around, checking for any eavesdroppers. Once he''s sure
    the coast is clear, he says:

    "My friend, my friend, I couldn''t help but
    overhear what happened with the commissioner. A real tragedy. But perhaps...
    I have something that might brighten your day. How about you hear me out on a
    little proposition?"
