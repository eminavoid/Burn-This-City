  npcText: "SUCCESS You study the strange letters for a moment... Patterns begin
    to emerge, repeating clusters, symmetrical shifts. It isn\u2019t random; it\u2019s
    deliberate. A Vigen\xE8re cipher, and the keyword is written plainly in the text
    itself: \u2018THIRDCOLUMN.\u2019 With that realization, the symbols start to
    unfold into words, and the message slowly reveals itself.\r\nThe code uses a
    Vigen\xE8re cipher, a form of letter substitution where each character is shifted
    along the alphabet by an amount determined by the keyword. In this case, the
    keyword \u2018THIRDCOLUMN\u2019 is repeated across the message. Each letter of
    the keyword tells how far to shift the corresponding letter of the text. By reversing
    those shifts, the jumble of letters resolves into the hidden message.\r\nElementary,
    really.\r\n"
