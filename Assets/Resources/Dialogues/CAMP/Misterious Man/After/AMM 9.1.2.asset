    look important\u2014too neat to be random, too deliberate to be nonsense. Maybe
    it\u2019s a code\u2026 or just a trick? You start jotting down letters, looking
    for patterns, anything that repeats. \u2018K\u2026 V\u2026 W\u2026\u2019\u2014none
    of it means anything. After a while, frustration sets in, but something about
    it feels structured, like there\u2019s a rhythm hidden beneath the chaos. Maybe
    someone who actually understands this stuff could crack it\u2026 but for now,
    it\u2019s just a wall of secrets."
