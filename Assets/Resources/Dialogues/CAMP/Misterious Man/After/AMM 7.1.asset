  npcName: Misterious Man
  npcText: 'The man lets out a sigh of relief and replies.

    "Of course he''ll
    pay! We''ve known each other for years! Ah, but one more thing. Don''t read the
    letter. It''s private, and trust me, there''s nothing interesting in it."

    He
    pauses for a moment, as if to emphasize the importance of what he just said,
    then continues:

    "If there''s nothing else, comrade, I''ll take my leave."

    Before
    you can respond, the man melts back into the camp, disappearing from view.
