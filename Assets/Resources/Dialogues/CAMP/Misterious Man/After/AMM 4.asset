  npcName: Misterious Man
  npcText: 'The man gives you a sly smile before continuing.

    "I knew you''d
    be interested! I''ll be brief. You see, I need to deliver a letter to a friend
    who lives in one of the apartments in the occupied district. Unfortunately, I
    can''t leave here until my documents are renewed, or I risk never being allowed
    back in! So, since you''re already on your way out, you could deliver my correspondence!
    I''m sure my friend will reward you handsomely. Well, what do you say? Do you
    accept?"

    The mysterious man impatiently waits for your answer.
